<h1 class="title">Navigation</h1>
<p>Before exploring the Moonstone Navigation Patterns, app designers should have a clear understanding of the webOS navigation philosophy and how the Moonstone controls and app structure enforce and support Remote Interactions, App Navigation, Panel Navigation, and Historical vs. Hierarchical Navigation.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-philosophy">Navigation Philosophy</h2>
<p>Navigation allows users to locate content and features, making it an essential part of any application. It is extremely important to follow a consistent pattern with respect to the location and behavior of navigational controls.</p>
<p>Set and meet expectations. If it is unclear whether clicking on something will take users to a new page, they may be hesitant to click on it. They may not want to leave the current view, or may be concerned with how long it will take to load the next view. This hesitation can lead to users’ not finding what they are looking for, not appreciating the value of the app, and, ultimately, not returning to use your app again.</p>
<p>Persistent navigation is a useful tool that flattens hierarchical app structures by providing the user with direct access to the top-level categories. However, we recommended that applications for TV follow the simple <a href="navigation/hub-and-spoke.html">Hub and Spoke</a> navigation pattern. Simplified objectives and minimal onscreen UI help to make for a successful “lean back” experience.</p>
<p>Bring content to the surface as soon as possible, as this helps to keep the experience simple and personal. Make content discovery easy by displaying recommended and favorited items in the top level of the application.</p>
<p>Aim to create a shallow application structure, as this promotes a comfortable level of location awareness for the user. Try to make 80% of the most common use cases achievable in one view. However, do not do this at the cost of overloading the experience. If a view is not easily scanned or navigated, the balance between information and usability has been lost. Less information is better.</p>
<h2 id="remote-interactions">Remote Interactions</h2>
<p>When designing apps for the TV, it is important that they work with both possible remote controls–the LG Magic Remote and the Conventional Remote. The webOS patterns are optimized to work best with the LG Magic Remote, which provides unique interactivity with its pointer and scroll wheel. The features of the conventional remote, such as the 5-way control, must also be taken into account for those users who do not have the Magic Remote.</p>
<h2 id="application-edges">Application Edges</h2>
<p>Several of the webOS Patterns use the edges of the screen to invoke UI with the Magic Remote pointer (similar to a gesture). The right edge of the screen is used to hide and show panels when the basement is being used for fullscreen content. The left edge of the screen may be used to hide and show the Left Drawer for <a href="navigation/global-navigation.html">global navigation</a>. While viewing panels, the top edge may be used to hide and show the Top Drawer for <a href="navigation/feature-navigation.html">feature navigation</a>. While viewing fullscreen content in the basement, the top edge is used to show content details and the bottom edge is used for playback controls.</p>
<p>Because not every app will make use of all of these patterns, you may wish to use an edge for something else. Since these patterns are used across many apps, an expectation has been set of what the user might find when pointing to an edge. Keep these expectations in mind when choosing to use an edge for something new.</p>
<h2 id="panel-navigation">Panel Navigation</h2>
<p>A significant consideration when designing navigation is the readability of a panel. Headers, subheaders, sub-subheaders, and breadcrumbs should all be descriptive, providing context as to where users are and what they should do.</p>
<p>With the Magic Remote, navigating a panel is done with a simple point and click. For conventional remotes, the Moonstone Panel controls contain built-in logic to simplify 5-way navigation within panels and across panels.</p>
<p>When navigating within a panel using the 5-way, focus will usually start in the body or the action bar. Left and Right presses will move focus through the action bar. Pressing Up from the action bar will move focus to a top drawer, if one exists; pressing Down will move focus to the body.</p>
<p>Pressing Left from the leftmost item in the Action Bar or Body will act as a Back keypress, moving the focus to the previous panel. Pressing Right from the rightmost item in the Action Bar or Body will either move focus to the next panel (if the next panel is already open and viewable) or to the “hide panels” indicator (if there is content loaded in the basement).</p>
<h2 id="historical-navigation-vs.-hierarchical-navigation">Historical Navigation vs. Hierarchical Navigation</h2>
<p>Historical navigation refers to a back navigation policy that returns users to where they were last. Hierarchical navigation refers to a back navigation policy that takes the user back up through the hierarchy of the application.</p>
<p>On their own, panels have no built-in concept of hierarchy or history. It is up to the application to decide which navigation policy is best. Both options have their problems. The most obvious problem with hierarchical navigation is that back navigation does not always return users to where they were last. The most obvious problem with historical navigation is that, if the user continues to open new panels from the previous panel, it can become tedious to navigate back through all the history created.</p>
<p>We recommend that applications follow a historical navigation policy. This means that when new content is loaded, it should load in a new panel (the next panel) rather than replace the content in the current panel.</p>
<p>While we believe that there is more value in supporting users’ expectations of location and where back navigation will take them than there is in minimizing the depth of the navigation history, this does not mean that minimizing depth is unimportant. We have provided several patterns that help reduce the depth of history or the need to open new panels. If these patterns are used correctly, users who find themselves 5 to 10 panels deep can quickly and easily navigate back through the panels via breadcrumbs, by pressing the Left key through each panel, or by pressing the Back button on the remote. A user can also press and hold the Back button to jump back to the first panel.</p>
